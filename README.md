# Easy Pass

During the Covid19 pandemic, it becomes difficult to invite people for any event keeping in mind the restrictions on the number of people attending the event.

Easy Pass helps you solve this problem, send a link to your guests asking them to register themselves for the event. They do it on their mobile phones and generate their own passes in seconds.They then come with the screenshot or a print of the pass to your event. No more problem of regulating the number of attendees!
